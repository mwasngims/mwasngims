<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I am a learner of the **ALX Backend Program** and have recently completed my **fourth year of BSc in Software Engineering**. I'm currently on a journey to become a world-class backend software engineer.

I started with software engineering because I’ve always been fascinated by how powerful systems like Google or WhatsApp work behind the scenes and how digital tools can solve real problems at scale.

I'm passionate about **building robust backend systems**, designing clean architecture, and creating tools that are both efficient and scalable.

What inspires me is **the opportunity to use technology to make meaningful impact, automate solutions, and improve lives through clean, reliable systems**.
